title : "Catalan - Classification of Cat Sounds by Emotion"
content: |
  Have you ever wanted to understand what a cat is trying to say? Well now we are one step closer to realising this technology. <code>cat-alan</code> is an app hosted with Streamlit that takes uploaded audio/video of cat sounds, and tries to categorise them into 1 of 10 emotions. The model is based off the M5 architecture trained on roughly 3000 labelled cat audio clips. A link to the deployment can be found <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/dogeplusplus/cat-alan/main/app.py">here</a>.
