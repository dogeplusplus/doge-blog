summary: 
  With a background in Mathematics from the University of Warwick, I specialize in machine learning applications across the life sciences.

  My career began in data consultancy, where I built data pipelines for clients.

  As a Machine Learning Engineer, I have conducted research, developed infrastructure, and created tools to enhance the research productivity of biologists.

  Currently, I am developing and scaling machine learning models for the sequence and structure analysis of small molecules and proteins, which are critical for drug discovery and development.

  My expertise spans the full software development lifecycle, from model development to MLOps, bridging the gap between machine learning research and engineering to solve critical problems.
