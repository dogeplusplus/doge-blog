summary: 
  After studying Mathematics at the University of Warwick, I started my career in data as a consultant, helping clients build data pipelines to make sense of their data.
  

  I grew a passion for machine learning and became a Deep Learning Engineer where I performed research, developed infrastructure, and built tools that accelerate the research throughput of biologists. Now I am scaling up machine learning pipelines that increase the throughput and accuracy of analysing medical images, which have applications in supporting medical diagnosis and drug development.
  

  My interests span a range of domains in Machine Learning that try to solve some of the biggest problems faced in our world. From model development to operations, from research to system design, I help bridge the gap between machine learning research and engineering.
