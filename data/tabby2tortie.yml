title : "CycleGAN Cat - Style transfer of Mackerel Tabby to Tortoiseshell Cats"
content: |
  Convert the fur coats of tabby cats to tortoiseshell and vice versa using a TensorFlow implementation of Cycle-GAN. Features include support for UNet and ResNet generators, saving/retraining, Tensorboard logging, and visualisation with Streamlit. I use DVC for dataset versioning, and Prefect flows to perform batch jobs such as scraping images using the PetFinder API or serializing to TFRecords.
