title : "Ball Balancer - Training Unity ML Agents using PPO"
content: |
  This is a demo of training an agent using Unity ML-Agents. This shows how to interact with environments provided by Unity, and uses a PyTorch implementation of PPO from OpenAI's spinning up library, instead of using <code>mlagents-learn</code> directly. There is some parallelisation of environments using MPI which allows for faster training.
