title : "Torch Actor-Critic - Soft Actor-Crtic Applied to MuJoCo"
content: |
  <code>torch-actor-critic</code> is a PyTorch implementation of Soft Actor-Critic to play around with <code>MuJoCo</code> environments. Includes <code>mlflow</code> logging to record experiments and explore different model/algorithm hyperparameters. Also includes some wrapper code to interact with the <code>dm_control</code> wall runner environment (WIP), and CNN-based actor networks that incorporate image observations.
